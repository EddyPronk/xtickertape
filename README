INTRODUCTION

XTickertape is a scrolling one-line window of event notifications,
providing you with information from many sources in a minimum of
screen space.  It is built on top of the Elvin notification service
and can be used to monitor computational activites or simply to chat
with other tickertape users.

PREREQUISITES

In order to compile XTickertape you will need X11, Motif or lesstif,
and the aforementioned Elvin notification service.  Additionally, if
you want to be able to view MIME attachments you will need to have
metamail installed.  The following URLs may be of use:

Metamail:
ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/nsb/mm2.7.tar.Z

Elvin:
http://elvin.dstc.com/

Lesstif:
http://www.lesstif.org/

X11

INSTALLATION

The quick way:

./configure
make
make install

By default, xtickertape installs itself in /usr/local which means that 
it will be unable to access its app-defaults file unless your
XFILESEARCHPATH environment variable is set to something like
/usr/local/lib/X11/%T/%N:%D (see the man page for XtResolvePathname
for more information on XFILESEARCHPATH).  The other alternative is to 
install xtickertape in the X tree (--prefix=/usr on most platforms,
--prefix=/usr/openwin on Solaris, --prefix=/usr/X11R6 on Linux).

For more information on installation see the INSTALL file in this
directory.
