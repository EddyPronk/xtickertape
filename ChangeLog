	* message_glyph.c: being more pedantic about the calculation of
		  the lbearing and rbearing of a string.

	* Control.c: added a workaround for a lesstif bug.  Now it should
		  be impossible to get multiple selected messages in the
		  history box.

1999-09-19  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* history.c: keeping the bottom item of the history in view as new 
		  items are added.

	* tickertape.c, Subscription.c, UsenetSubscription.c, mail_sub.c:
		  freeing the elvin notification once we're done with it

1999-09-14  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* Scroller.c: reusing the GC's clip mask whenever possible.

1999-09-13  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* message_glyph.c: recording the left and right bearing of each
		  string in a message for a quick and accurate check of
		  whether or not it should be repainted.  Moved this check 
		  back into do_paint() so that we aren't needlessly
		  changing graphics contexts.
	* MailSubscription.c: renamed to mail_sub.c and corresponding name
		  reforms.  Reworked the code to use mbox_parser code
		  stolen from scoop and no longer use StringBuffer.c.

1999-09-12  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* Scroller.c: width of the gap is now determined from the size of
		  the Scroller's font
	* message_glyph.o: width of the gap between messages is now
		  determined from the size of the Scroller's font

1999-09-09  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* *.h, *.c: renamed Message to message_t and Message.[hc] to
		  message.[hc] throughout.  The great name reform has begun!

1999-09-08  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* Scroller.c: fixed a bogus unsigned comparison which could result 
		  in a negative width for the gap
	* Scroller.c: leaving the decision of whether or not to paint any
		  portion of a glyph up to the glyph itself
	* gap.c: no longer drawing the gap since the new scroller code
		  already erases stuff to the background color
	* history.h: added some prototypes to keep the compiler happy
	* message_glyph.c: now taking into account the left/right bearing
		  of a character as well as its width.  This makes
		  italicized  look a lot better
	* message_glyph.c: using unsigned characters to get character
		  information which works better for things like Æ and é.

1999-09-01  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* history.c: fixed an obscure threading bug.

1999-08-30  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* Version-1.6 released
	* history.c: added an #include and a prototype to get rid of some
		     warnings
