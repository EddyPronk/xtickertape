	* panel.c: The tool-tip is not cancelled by a keyboard event

1999-10-19  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* usenet_sub.c: fixed the spelling of KEYWORDS
	
1999-10-07  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* panel.c: added a tool-tip to the history panel which displays
		  the attachment of the message under the pointer.
	
	* history.h, history.c: added a way to find the message in the
		  history at a given x, y position

	* ScrollerP.h, Scroller.c: minor tweaks to the timer code.

1999-10-06  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* mail_sub.c: fixed a bug that got introduced in some of
		  yesterday's tidyings.  Silly, silly bug.

	* main.c, tickertape.h, tickertape.c: rearranged the domain stuff
		  so that it can be specified on the command-line or in an 
		  environment variable.
	
1999-10-05  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* List.h, List.c: removed
	
	* Hash.h, Hash.c: removed

	* Control.h, Control.c: renamed to panel.h, panel.c.  Effected the
		  great naming reform in this last file.

	* All: lots of tidying
	
1999-10-04  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* FileStreamTokenizer.h, FileStreamTokenizer.c: removed
	
	* StringBuffer.h, StringBuffer.c: removed

	* UsenetSubscription.h, UsenetSubscription.c: removed

	* tickertape.c: Purged old UsenetSubscription stuff and replaced
		  it with the exciting new usenet_sub and usenet_parser.

1999-10-03  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* List.c: fixed an ancient bug with inserting at the end of the list 

1999-10-02  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* tickertape.c: renamed OrbitSubscription to orbit_sub_t

	* Control.c: fixed the miscount of the number of digits in the
		  year portion of the message-id.  This will break again
		  in 10000AD.

	* Control.c: set minimum width and height for the control panel
		  and the about box based on their initial sizes.
	
1999-09-29  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* message_glyph.c: This time I think I've got it -- when measuring 
		  character which don't have a glyph in the current font,
		  use the dimensions of default_char.  If, however,
		  default_char does not have a glyph then all dimensions
		  default to zero.

1999-09-27  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* message_glyph.c: Characters which don't have a glyph in the
		  current font are now measured correctly.

1999-09-26  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* ElvinConnection.h, ElvinConnection.c, others: naming reform hits 
		  here.  Files are now called connect.[hc].

	* INSTALL: put in the default text from automake

	* README: wrote some text

	* mail_sub.c: Removed the trailing '\n' from the subscription
		  expression since it's not needed and it wasn't accounted 
		  for in the malloc and could cause core dumps!

	* main.c: Added a signal handler for SIGHUP which reloads the
		  groups and usenet subscriptions.

1999-09-22  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* message_glyph.c: being more pedantic about the calculation of
		  the lbearing and rbearing of a string.

	* Control.c: added a workaround for a lesstif bug.  Now it should
		  be impossible to get multiple selected messages in the
		  history box.

1999-09-19  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* history.c: keeping the bottom item of the history in view as new 
		  items are added.

1999-09-15  Ted Phelps  <phelps@pobox.com>

	* tickertape.c, Subscription.c, UsenetSubscription.c, mail_sub.c:
		  freeing the elvin notification once we're done with it

1999-09-14  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* Scroller.c: reusing the GC's clip mask whenever possible.

1999-09-13  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* message_glyph.c: recording the left and right bearing of each
		  string in a message for a quick and accurate check of
		  whether or not it should be repainted.  Moved this check 
		  back into do_paint() so that we aren't needlessly
		  changing graphics contexts.
	* MailSubscription.c: renamed to mail_sub.c and corresponding name
		  reforms.  Reworked the code to use mbox_parser code
		  stolen from scoop and no longer use StringBuffer.c.

1999-09-12  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* Scroller.c: width of the gap is now determined from the size of
		  the Scroller's font
	* message_glyph.o: width of the gap between messages is now
		  determined from the size of the Scroller's font

1999-09-09  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* *.h, *.c: renamed Message to message_t and Message.[hc] to
		  message.[hc] throughout.  The great name reform has begun!

1999-09-08  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* Scroller.c: fixed a bogus unsigned comparison which could result 
		  in a negative width for the gap
	* Scroller.c: leaving the decision of whether or not to paint any
		  portion of a glyph up to the glyph itself
	* gap.c: no longer drawing the gap since the new scroller code
		  already erases stuff to the background color
	* history.h: added some prototypes to keep the compiler happy
	* message_glyph.c: now taking into account the left/right bearing
		  of a character as well as its width.  This makes
		  italicized  look a lot better
	* message_glyph.c: using unsigned characters to get character
		  information which works better for things like Æ and é.

1999-09-01  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* history.c: fixed an obscure threading bug.

1999-08-30  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* Version-1.6 released
	* history.c: added an #include and a prototype to get rid of some
		     warnings
