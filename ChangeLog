	* *.h, *.c: renamed Message to message_t and Message.[hc] to
		  message.[hc] throughout.  The great name reform has begun!

	* Scroller.c: fixed a bogus unsigned comparison which could result 
		  in a negative width for the gap
	* Scroller.c: leaving the decision of whether or not to paint any
		  portion of a glyph up to the glyph itself
	* gap.c: no longer drawing the gap since the new scroller code
		  already erases stuff to the background color
	* history.h: added some prototypes to keep the compiler happy
	* message_glyph.c: now taking into account the left/right bearing
		  of a character as well as its width.  This makes
		  italicized  look a lot better
	* message_glyph.c: using unsigned characters to get character
		  information which works better for things like Æ and é.

	* history.c: fixed an obscure threading bug.

1999-08-30  Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>

	* Version-1.6 released
	* history.c: added an #include and a prototype to get rid of some
		     warnings
