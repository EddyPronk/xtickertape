Things that would be nice to have in future versions of xtickertape:

- A way of sending a message without closing the control panel.  This
  appears to be a good trap for jtickertape users.  Perhaps not.

- You should be able to traverse the list of messages you have sent by 
  using C-p and C-n like you can with every GNU program.  It's
  probably not that useful to keep history information around,
  especially since the *last* message is still available when you
  click on the tickertape.

- It should be possible to have the scrolling speed change when the
  mouse enters/leaves the scroller.  I'm not sure yet how '=' and '-'
  should affect this...

- Get the history to behave properly when the control panel is
  resized.  It seems to think that it's more important to keep the
  first list item in place than the last one, even if this means
  leaving a gaping white space at the bottom of the list.  Bizarre.

- Perhaps the control panel should resize in increments corresponding
  to a complete line in the history?  Not until the major window
  managers handle the resources properly.

- The length of the history should be configurable (how?
  configuration file?  I'd like to do this via a resource but it
  doesn't look like it'll be easy without building a widget...)

- It should be possible to specify the location of `metamail' at
  both configure-time and run-time.  It should also be possible to
  *not* redirect its output to /dev/null so that its possible to debug 
  metamail-related problems without having to recompile.
