Things that would be nice to have in future versions of xtickertape:

- Better parsers for the groups and usenet files which can provide
  useful error messages and perhaps even carry on in spite of errors

- A way of sending a message without closing the control panel

- Mostly consistent naming -- Scroller* will need to remain uppercase
  to be consistent with the Xt widget naming scheme, but all other
  files should switch the more C-friendly this_is_a_name style

- Get rid of Hash.[hc] and List.[hc] and use the stuff in libdstc instead

- Non-empty INSTALL and README files

- You should be able to traverse the list of messages you have sent by 
  using C-p and C-n like you can with every GNU program

- It should be possible to have the scrolling speed change when the
  mouse enters/leaves the scroller.  I'm not sure yet how '=' and '-'
  should affect this...
