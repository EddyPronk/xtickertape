Things that would be nice to have in future versions of xtickertape:

- A way of sending a message without closing the control panel

- You should be able to traverse the list of messages you have sent by 
  using C-p and C-n like you can with every GNU program

- It should be possible to have the scrolling speed change when the
  mouse enters/leaves the scroller.  I'm not sure yet how '=' and '-'
  should affect this...

- Support for message replacement (useful for monitoring automated
  stuff like cricket scores).

- Get the history to behave properly when the control panel is
  resized.  It seems to think that it's more important to keep the
  first list item in place than the last one, even if this means
  leaving a gaping white space at the bottom of the list.  Bizarre.
