Things that would be nice to have in future versions of xtickertape:

Configuration

- Errors in the configuration files should be reported to somewhere
  other than the terminal which started the program.  A message in the
  scroller is probably the most appropriate place. [Thanks Clinton Roy]

- Write replacement functions for XtVaXXX() so that we can run with
  older versions of X11.

Control Panel:

- You should be able to traverse the list of messages you have sent by 
  using C-p and C-n like you can with every GNU program.

- Add an Edit menu with Cut, Paste and Copy options which apply to the
  widget with focus.  This should allow us to cut and paste messages
  from the history into another application. [Thanks David Arnold]

Scroller:

- Deletion has less than satisfactory results on the scroller's state.
  It is not entirely clear what the `correct' behavior is in certain
  circumstances.


History Widget

- We should have resources for the colors to use when drawing the
  selected message so that people on black and white machines can
  still read it.

- The highlight around the selection which indicates that the widget
  has focus should acknowledge the highlight_thickness resource, which
  will need to affect the spacing between lines.

- Dragging should not occur until a threshold has been crossed.  This
  should make it less annoying to deselect an item as dragging
  automatically selects.

- The widget should scroll horizontally in response to mouse
  movement.  [Thanks Clinton Roy]

- The timestamp should optionally include the date as well as simply
  HH:MM(am|pm), and should be internationalized.  It should be
  possible to switch between date formats at runtime.

- Keyboard initiated scrolling should make the margin visible when the
  user attempts to select before the first message or after the last one.

- Attempting to scroll up or down (via keyboard or pointer) should
  make the margin visible in up to but not more than the size of a
  line at a time for the cases where the margin is actually larger
  than a single line.

- Check the max ascent and descent rather than blindly trusting the
  font description since it's known to have incorrect values for some
  fonts.

Miscellaneous:

- Support Thread-Id.

Scheme Interpreter [POSTPONED until v3]:

- This needs to be connected to everything so that we can do
  amusing things.

- It should be possible to evaluate the contents of the file.
