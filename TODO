Things that would be nice to have in future versions of xtickertape:

Configuration

- It should be possible to specify the location of `metamail' at
  both configure-time and run-time.  Perhaps both a command-line
  option and an environment variable would be useful.


Control Panel:

- You should be able to traverse the list of messages you have sent by 
  using C-p and C-n like you can with every GNU program.


Scroller:

- It should be possible to have the scrolling speed change when the
  mouse enters/leaves the scroller.  I'm not sure yet how '=' and '-'
  would affect this...

- Deletion has less than satisfactory results on the scroller's state.


History Widget

- We should have resources for the colors to use when drawing the
  selected line so that people on black and white machines can still
  read it.

- It should be possible to scroll horizontally from the keyboard.

- It should be able to perform Motif-style keyboard focus changes via
  the tab key.

- Dragging should not occur until a threshold has been crossed.  This
  should make it less annoying to deselect an item as dragging
  automatically selects.

- It should be possible to display a timestamp in front of each
  message.  The timestamp should optionally include the date as well
  as hour/minute/am|pm.

- Messages should be indented to indicate threading.  This will expose
  a bit of unimplemented functionality in regards to inserting a
  message somewhere other than the end of the list.

- Keyboard initiated scrolling should make the margin visible when the
  user attempts to select before the first message or after the last one.

- It should be possible to view the attachment of the selected message
  from the keyboard.


Scheme Interpreter:

- This needs to be connected to everything so that we can do
  amusing things.

- It should be possible to load and evaulate from a file.
