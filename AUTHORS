xtickertape was written by Ted Phelps <phelps@pobox.com>, with help
from David Arnold <d@pobox.com>.

It is based on the original python tickertape by Bill Segall
<bill@segall.net> with contributions from the Reject Room, and it
blatantly steals features introduced in jtickertape by Julian Boot
<boot@dstc.edu.au>
