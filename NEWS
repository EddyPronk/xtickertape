Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.6.0

* The `Message-Id' and `In-Reply-To' fields are now strings instead of 
  integers.  This matches the updated specification and allows
  messages to really have unique ids instead of merely hoping that the
  random number generator is good enough.

* Clicking on a message in the tickertape (to reply to it) now selects
  that message in the history.  Selecting an item in the history means 
  that you want to reply to that message and the group menu is updated 
  accordingly.

* A history of the last few messages sent is now shown at the bottom
  of the control panel window.  The history can be displayed in
  threaded or chronological order and a toggle under the `Options'
  menu lets the user switch between them.

* The new action drag() can be used to drag the tickertape's scroller
  around.  Not necessarily useful, but quite cute.

* delete() is now called expire().  The new delete() function
  removes a message from the scroller instantly.  expire() quickly
  fades a message to the background color and makes it go away once it 
  has safely scrolled off the screen.

* The scroller can now scroll both right-to-left (as it always did)
  and left-to-right.  This isn't quite as useless as it sounds -- in
  combination with the '+' and '-' keys you can back up and look at a
  message again after it has scrolled off the left edige.  It could
  also be useful for arabic, but that will require further changes to
  get the message order correct.

* If no `groups' or `usenet' files found in the TICKERDIR, then
  default ones are created so that new users can get started without
  having to steal someone else's preferences.

* The scroller now uses a single off-screen pixmap instead of one for
  each message.  This should reduce the amount of memory that
  tickertape uses in the X server, especially for *huge* fonts.  It's
  also somewhat smarter about which portion of the scroller needs to
  be updated.  This means that really long messages in huge fonts
  shouldn't kill the X server anymore.

* Fixed the way the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol is handled so that it
  works properly with both lesstif and Motif.

* Added a `Help' menu and an `About' box.

* The `not' operator in a usenet subscription no longer generates a
  bogus elvin subscription.

* show-url can now cope with URLs which contain spaces.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.10

* Fixed a bug in the reconnect code in which the delay between reconnect
  attempts was never being reset to the initial delay.

* Added the -nw option to show-url to placate users who only want to
  have one Nescape window open at a time.  Also made it possible to
  specify a difference netscape executable by setting the NETSCAPE
  environment variable.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.9

* Using configure to find metamail so that it doesn't have to be in
  the user's path at runtime

* Fixed a bug in show-url for the case where the URL is provided on
  the command-line

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.8

* add the actions to the scroller widget to speed up/slow down the
  scrolling speed.  Lots of fun, but probably not too useful

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.7

* Fixed the way notifications get their timeout so that xtickertape
  doesn't dump core if a notification with a matching TICKERTAPE
  arrives without a TIMEOUT entry.  Can also take a FLOAT timeout
  (although this is simply rounded off to the nearest integer)

* Added estore.c to the distribution.  This is a hacked version of
  mh's rcvstore which generates a notification from e-mail headers
  after it files a the e-mail message

* Fixed a really stupid bug which caused xtickertape to dump core if
  the user's TICKERDIR environment variable wasn't set.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.6

* show-url now converts troublesome characters (comma, right paren) to 
  their HTML escape codes before sending a URL to netscape

* Added a man page for show-url

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.5

* Fixed a bug in main.c which made xtickertape crash unless TICKERDIR
  was set to something
