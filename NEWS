Overview of changes in xtickertape-2.0

* Changed the application class from `Tickertape' to `XTickertape'.

* No longer redirecting the output of `metamail' to /dev/null, and
  using the `-x' option so that it doesn't try to talk to the tty.
  [Thanks David Leonard]

* Fixed a bug in the way the icon was created.  Now the big `e' will
  be read even on 8-bit displays.

* The scroller can now operate without an offscreen pixmap.  This
  enables hardware optimizations with some graphics cards, but results 
  in more traffic between the client and server.  The offscreen pixmap 
  option can still be enabled by setting the X resource
  XTickertape.scroller.usePixmap to True.

* Message replacement now works!

* Updated to use the elvin-4 client library instead of the elvin-3
  client library

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.6.6

* Minimum size of the control panel now takes into account the height
  of the horizontal scrollbar on the history list.

* Minor configure fix for machines which don't have a separate include
  file for crypt() (thanks David Leonard for pointing out that BSD
  machines don't have <crypt.h>).

* Check environment variables ELVIN_HOST and ELVIN_PORT if no
  command-line option given before using defaults (thanks David
  Leonard).

* Keyboard activity now hides tool-tips.

* Chased down some more memory leaks (bloody Motif!).

* The SIGHUP handler failed to re-register itself.  This is now fixed.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.6.5

* Items in the history window which have an attachment (by default
  these are displayed in a bold font) now display a tool-tip
  indicating what that attachment is.

* The user field now defaults to a combination of the user name and
  local domain.  These can be overridden with environment variables
  (USER/LOGNAME, DOMAIN) or on the command-line (--user/-u,
  --domain/-D).

* Completed the great tickertape naming reform.

* Plugged all known memory leaks.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.6.4

* Rebuilt the usenet and groups file parsers with an eye towards
  providing useful error messages when the parser fails.

* Now specifying minimum width and height for the control panel and
  about box based on their initial sizes.  The control panel may be
  shrunk until the history window disappears but no shorter.

* The uuid generator for message-ids included the host id of the
  sending machine.  While this is fine under Solaris, on some
  operating systems (notably Linux) the host id is the machine's
  IP address which makes anonymous posting substantially less
  anonymous.  We now run the host id through crypt and throw away the
  salt used to generate it.

* Really fixed the bug in the measuring of non-printing characters.
  The trick is to check the font's default_char to see if it is in the 
  range of glyphs before trying to use its measurements.  If it isn't, 
  then they all default to zero.  Hopefully.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.6.3

* Fixed a bug in the measuring of non-printing characters which
  resulted in an attractive yet incorrect double-imaging of messages
  on the scroller.

* Fixed a counting error in the e-mail subscription generation code
  which could result in a coredump depending on the length of the
  username.

* XTickertape now installs a signal handler for SIGHUP which reloads
  the groups and usenet subscription files.

* The history now keeps the bottom item in the history visible as new
  items are added (hopefully) without being annoying when the user is
  trying to scroll the history or reply to a message.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.6.2

* The widths of the gaps between messages are now based on the size of 
  the Scroller's font instead of being completely arbitrary.

* Plugged a memory leak -- one must release ones notifications once
  one has finished playing with them

* Further tweaks of the Scroller resulting in rather dramatic
  reduction of X network traffic when there are lots of messages on
  the scroller.

* Partial major naming reform.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.6.1

* Fixed a bug in the history stuff which could crash xtickertape when
  a reply was made to an old thread

* Fixed a gap_width problem which showed up with wide messages

* Better handling of italicized messages

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.6.0

* Added the ability to kill a conversation thread.  Messages will
  still appear in the history but they won't scroll across the tickertape.

* The `Message-Id' and `In-Reply-To' fields are now strings instead of 
  integers.  This matches the updated specification and allows
  messages to really have unique ids instead of merely hoping that the
  random number generator is good enough.

* Clicking on a message in the tickertape (to reply to it) now selects
  that message in the history.  Selecting an item in the history means 
  that you want to reply to that message and the group menu is updated 
  accordingly.

* A history of the last few messages sent is now shown at the bottom
  of the control panel window.  The history can be displayed in
  threaded or chronological order and a toggle under the `Options'
  menu lets the user switch between them.  Messages with attachments
  are displayed in the history list in a bold font (or whichever font
  has the MIME tag in the fontList), and their attachment may be
  viewed by double-clicking on them.

* The new action drag() can be used to drag the tickertape's scroller
  around.  Not necessarily useful, but quite cute.

* delete() is now called expire().  The new delete() function
  removes a message from the scroller instantly.  expire() quickly
  fades a message to the background color and makes it go away once it 
  has safely scrolled off the screen.

* The scroller can now scroll both right-to-left (as it always did)
  and left-to-right.  This isn't quite as useless as it sounds -- in
  combination with the '+' and '-' keys you can back up and look at a
  message again after it has scrolled off the left edige.  It could
  also be useful for arabic, but that will require further changes to
  get the message order correct.

* If no `groups' or `usenet' files found in the TICKERDIR, then
  default ones are created so that new users can get started without
  having to steal someone else's preferences.

* The scroller now uses a single off-screen pixmap instead of one for
  each message.  This should reduce the amount of memory that
  tickertape uses in the X server, especially for *huge* fonts.  It's
  also somewhat smarter about which portion of the scroller needs to
  be updated.  This means that really long messages in huge fonts
  shouldn't kill the X server anymore.

* Fixed the way the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol is handled so that it
  works properly with both lesstif and Motif.

* Added a `Help' menu and an `About' box.

* The `not' operator in a usenet subscription no longer generates a
  bogus elvin subscription.

* show-url can now cope with URLs which contain spaces.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.10

* Fixed a bug in the reconnect code in which the delay between reconnect
  attempts was never being reset to the initial delay.

* Added the -nw option to show-url to placate users who only want to
  have one Nescape window open at a time.  Also made it possible to
  specify a difference netscape executable by setting the NETSCAPE
  environment variable.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.9

* Using configure to find metamail so that it doesn't have to be in
  the user's path at runtime

* Fixed a bug in show-url for the case where the URL is provided on
  the command-line

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.8

* add the actions to the scroller widget to speed up/slow down the
  scrolling speed.  Lots of fun, but probably not too useful

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.7

* Fixed the way notifications get their timeout so that xtickertape
  doesn't dump core if a notification with a matching TICKERTAPE
  arrives without a TIMEOUT entry.  Can also take a FLOAT timeout
  (although this is simply rounded off to the nearest integer)

* Added estore.c to the distribution.  This is a hacked version of
  mh's rcvstore which generates a notification from e-mail headers
  after it files a the e-mail message

* Fixed a really stupid bug which caused xtickertape to dump core if
  the user's TICKERDIR environment variable wasn't set.

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.6

* show-url now converts troublesome characters (comma, right paren) to 
  their HTML escape codes before sending a URL to netscape

* Added a man page for show-url

Overview of changes in xtickertape-1.5.5

* Fixed a bug in main.c which made xtickertape crash unless TICKERDIR
  was set to something
